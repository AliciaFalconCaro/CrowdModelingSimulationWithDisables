## Abstract
Here we present an effective application of adaptive cooperative networks for assisting 1 disables navigating in the crowd in a pandemic or emergency situation. To achieve this, we model 2 the crowd movement and introduce a cooperative learning approach to enable cooperation and 3 self-organization of the crowd members with impaired health or on wheelchair to ensure their safe 4 movement in the crowd. Here, it is assumed that the movement path and the varying locations of the 5 other crowd members can be estimated by each agent. Therefore, the network nodes (agents) should 6 continuously reorganize themselves by varying their speeds and distances from each other, walls, 7 and obstacles, within a predefined limit. It is also demonstrated how the available wireless trackers 8 such as iPhone and AirTag can be used for this purpose. The model effectiveness is examined with 9 respect to the real-time changes in environment parameters and its efficacy verified
