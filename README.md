## Abstract
Here we present an effective application of adaptive cooperative networks for assisting disables navigating in the crowd in a pandemic or emergency situation. To achieve this, we model the crowd movement and introduce a cooperative learning approach to enable cooperation and self-organization of the crowd members with impaired health or on wheelchair to ensure their safe movement in the crowd. Here, it is assumed that the movement path and the varying locations of the other crowd members can be estimated by each agent. Therefore, the network nodes (agents) should continuously reorganize themselves by varying their speeds and distances from each other, walls, and obstacles, within a predefined limit. It is also demonstrated how the available wireless trackers such as iPhone and AirTag can be used for this purpose. The model effectiveness is examined with respect to the real-time changes in environment parameters and its efficacy verified
